One day, I thought...
-------------------
"I wanna **printing suppprt** of the Markdown Presenter for sharing my slides on the slideshare.com..."

**Fork!** > Change > Commit -> **Pull Request.**

Chris said...
-------------
"OK! I'll accept your request... merged!"

!

Several days later, I thought...
-------------------
"I often use _Surface Pro_, so I wanna **touch support**..."

Change > Commit > **Pull Request.**

!

Chris said...
-------------
"OK... I'll accept your request... merged."

!

After a few more days, I thought...
